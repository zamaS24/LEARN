Chroma with langchain (LangChain with chroma db docs directly): 
    - you can here use the embedding model 
    - combine it with Chroma
    - it creates a colleciotn named langchain



Chroma: (Chroma db documentation direclty man )
    - client (the database) 
    - persistent client (we will have persistent directory)
    - client may have multiple collections
    - collection is a : list of documents, list of ids
    - collection.add(documents=, ids=)


Passing Chroma Client to langchain : 
    langchain_chroma = Chroma(
        client=persistent_client,
        collection_name="collection_name",
        embedding_function=embedding_function,
    )



Documents: 
    - loader:  pdf, web, ..; etc
    - langchain doucument : 



# FUTURE WORK AND CONSIDERATION: 
    -> deploying
    -> how to measure the amount of GPU needed for such tasks
    -> messaging templates, and parameters of the model, like temperature and all . 
    -> memory in the conversation 
    -> Agentic RAG. 
    -> Evaluation
