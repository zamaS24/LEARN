Lisf of essential vim motions that are also combined with vscode: 

- deleting the current line 
    dd 


- select and copy multiple stuff start selecting stuff 
    v (to go to the mode of selecting)
    yy (to copy it to clipboard I guess) 
    or 


    - go the first of the line 
        0 or (I, but will put you on the first character and it's on insert mode )

copy the current line 
    yy  


Beginning of the first character of the line 
    _ (it's underscore)

    
Indent to the right of the block 
    < for indent left
    > for indent right 

Copy the whole line 
    dd : copy the whole line, and when you paste it with p it will pop it down the current cursor 


   the this is the real time of it okay ? as been programmin all of his life in this matter if you already don't know about it okay  
   print('this is the real value of it right ? ')

    cout the real values of this one right ? 
    print('somethign happening in the real time of it okay ? ')
